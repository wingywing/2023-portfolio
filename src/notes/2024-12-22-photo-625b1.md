Good day today! Caught up with some high school friends and baked some cookies :D

Got the cookie cutters and bags from Daiso

Followed [this recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/butter-cookies-hato-sabure-recipe/) for the cookies (added the cashews and chocolate + replaced sugar with brown baking truvia)

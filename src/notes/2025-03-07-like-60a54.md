        note: |-
          Hi, I'm Aaron Parecki, Director of Identity Standards at Okta, and co-founder of
          IndieWebCamp.
          I maintain oauth.net, write and consult about OAuth, and
          participate in the OAuth Working Group at the IETF. I also help people learn about video production and livestreaming. (detailed bio)

          I've been tracking my location since 2008 and I wrote 100 songs in 100 days.
          I've spoken at conferences around the world about
          owning your data,
          OAuth,
          quantified self,
          and explained why R is a vowel. Read more.

      Update day! I got the Logitech Lift (For business?)

      It is smaller than my MX Vertical. The buttons and the scroll wheel has been heaviliy damped so they are silenced and less clicky, similar to a touchpad - I assume that the business part?

      The mouse is quite a bit smaller. Looking at it, it looks to be a greater fit for my hand.. But right now it feels too small. 

      So far I am not happy with it, but I do like the less clicky part so I think I'll keep it.

I've never used a vertical mouse before...

Would really love to try it thoughâ€”borrowed an Apple Magic Touch Pad from my workplace and really love it, but wrapping up with them in a week. ðŸ˜¢

Might consider getting one! My hands are super tiny so I'll look into the Logitech Lift in-store.

      Sorry to hear about to job, blebbb! :(

      Would recommend if you got a smaller hand -- I believe I saw a reddit post about their experience being great with it :)

      I am overall happy with it so far.

I saw it in-store on the weekend!
I quite liked how it looked and felt but they only had the black and pink one in stock.
A bit worried that the off-white would stain though (the pink display one looked a bit grimy :( ). Might keep my eyes peeled for an alternative since I'm a light-mode kinda gal.

I went to OUTTA coffee with my friend yesterday between university classes. :)

Must try their matcha latte! Was one of the best I've had. Very smooth and deep in flavour.

Got the chance to do some drawing in my journal using new acrylic markers! Really enjoying taking time out of the day to be present.

Had [Rusty's Retirement](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2666510/Rustys_Retirement/) and [Virtual Cottage](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1369320/Virtual_Cottage/) running in the background. Good vibes.

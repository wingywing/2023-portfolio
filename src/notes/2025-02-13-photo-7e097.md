Last night, we went to Cafe Kooks for an early Valentine's Day dinner. It was their Roti Masterclass section and we learned for ourselves how hard it was to make a good roti!

The photos here show the chef's roti, which all have big air pockets to give it more of a flakey, airy texture. There were multiple groups of people and none of us could make a roti that had anywhere close to such a big bubble!

Food was amazing as well and Toan got to try different styles of roti for the first time.

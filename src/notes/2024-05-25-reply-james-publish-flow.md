        			<p><em>The intended audience for this post is programmers.</em></p>
        <p>My blog post publishing process is convoluted. To publish a blog post, I have to:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Go to GitHub, where my blog is hosted.</li>
        <li>Navigate to my repository.</li>
        <li>Go into the posts folder.</li>
        <li>Wait for the page to load properly, since there are so many posts.</li>
        <li>Click <code>Add file</code>.</li>
        <li>Copy-paste the metadata from another blog post so I can set my post title, categories, and other pieces of information (and it can take a few seconds to find the right post from which I want to copy, since not all posts have the same metadata).</li>
        <li>Copy-paste my post content from the text editor I use, Typora, into the file on GitHub.</li>
        <li>Create the file.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My static site generator then turns the file into a web page.</p>
        <p>If I want to include an image in my post, I <em>also</em> have to:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Find, then click to go to, the assets folder in GitHub where all my images are stored.</li>
        <li>Click to upload an image.</li>
        <li>Upload an image.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is a lot of steps. And I have been following them for at least six months.</p>
        <p>This week, after talking with some fellow website makers, I had an idea: I could make a tool to simplify this.</p>
        <p>I did some research earlier today and found that there is a link structure you can use to take content and auto-paste it into GitHub. Herein lay an opportunity: I could make a form where I can type in all of the information I need for a post (i.e. title, post content), and auto-fill others (i.e. publication date). This form could have a button that structures all the information in the way required for my site to understand it, then open GitHub with the final post ready to publish.</p>
        <p>The URL structure is:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-text">
        `https://github.com/capjamesg/jamesg.blog/new/main/_posts/?filename=${filename}.md&amp;value={file_contents}`;
        </code></pre>

        <p>This afternoon, I made a web page that meets these requirements, allowing me to skip all of the steps above and format a post in a form I made. I can type in the information I need to publish a blog post, click a few buttons, and my blog post will be in GitHub. The form automatically adds the date and time a post was published, so I no longer have to add that to my posts. It also lists several categories that I use often from which I can choose, eliminating the risk I use the wrong name for a category (something I do often!).</p>
        <p>My form URL-encodes the file contents so the contents show up properly in GitHub when the form submits.</p>
        <p>The form doesn't actually create anything on my site: it creates the page and redirects me to GitHub, where I can click submit to save the file.</p>
        <p>Here is the form on my website, the final result of the project:</p>
        <p><a href="https://jamesg.blog/assets/publishing.png"></a><a href="https://jamesg.blog/assets/publishing.png"><img src="https://jamesg.blog/assets/publishing.png" alt="Publishing form"></a></p>
        <p>If you are interested in how this page works, the page is public! <a href="https://jamesg.blog/create/">View the blog post create page.</a></p>
        <p>I had a lot of fun making this tool. I had a problem -- a slow, convoluted, verging-on-frustrating publishing process -- and was able to make something simpler. I now wonder if I should add boxes for common things I need when formatting posts before publishing, like the HTML tags I use for code snippets. The opportunities are exciting! My mind is also thinking about other publishing tools I could make for use in my work as a technical writer.</p>
        <p>This is my first post published using the new tool! I'm excited!</p>

        		Herein, my mascot will be MJ and James. Or perhaps any of the myriad other nicknames I am likely to come up with over the years.

        		I hired someone to design this mascot. The aforelinked post provides more information and a recommendation for the designer!

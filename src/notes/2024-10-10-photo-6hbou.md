Tried out Kafe Kooks with a friend yeaterday. Love the vibes there and roti is pretty good too. â˜º

I liked how the cafe had so much personality--Kooks being named after the Bowie song, and Kafe referring to its Indonesian heritage. The shop is decorated with a lot of David Bowie!

$16 for the roti with sauces. Sticky chai is pretty nice too.

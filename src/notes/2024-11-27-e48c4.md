Bought an LG G4 TV. Was so excited to use it when it arrived yesterday, but they forgot to send the stand as well. ðŸ¥² 

It comes with a wall mount but the wall separates my room from the bathroom and might have plumbing inside.

If you didn't receive a stand with your G4, make sure to give them a ring! I ordered from JBHIFI and they said they'll deliver it tomorrow.

Hoorah!

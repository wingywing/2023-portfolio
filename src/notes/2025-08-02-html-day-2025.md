Today (or rather yesterday), Toan and I went to [HTML in Hyde](https://maxbo.me/html-in-hyde/) hosted by [Max Bo](https://maxbo.me) as part of [HTML Day 2025](https://html.energy/).

It was super cute and was hosted at [Wilson Cafe](https://www.wilsoncafe.com.au/) due to the rain.

The event lasted for around 2 hours and I really enjoyed chatting to people about their small projects and seeing what everyone got up to by the end of the afternoon.

You can see all the projects [here](https://maxbo.me/html-in-hyde/1/projects/).

I tried out HTML Components and made [this gingerbread person](/fun/gingerbread). ChatGPT was great help in figuring out how to get the Javascript to work. :P A lot of learning today.

Toan's laptop ran out of battery, but he finished off his [nyan dancing faces](/fun/nyan-party) at home. It is super cute and I love it :D.  

Hoping there are more HTML-related events in Sydney later down the line!

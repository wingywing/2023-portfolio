A short webmedia project that utilises practice-led research to explore the ethics of AI art. In this project, I trained an AI model based on Stable Diffusion 1.5 to draw in my illustrative style. The website was coded with **ReactJS** and **Typescript**, and animated with the **Framer Motion animation library**.

## Special thanks
Thank you to the director of Open Law – [Michael Green SC](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-green-sc-42118b1/) for the opportunity to work on this project. I would also like to thank [Nick&nbsp;Clark](https://clarx.dev/) who showed me the ropes to Tailwind, SASS and taught me so much about frontend development with immense patience.

## 1. The Team

| Human | Role |
|:-- |:--|
| [The&nbsp;Open&nbsp;Law&nbsp;Team](https://openlaw.com.au/) | The software development team are the ones who bring my designs to life. Can't do it without the team!|
| Me! | Lead Designer – completely overhauled the user interface from scratch using reusable components from my [UI Design System](/projects/openlaw/) to **enhance the end-to-end user experience**. <br/> </br> Assisted the frontend development team by developing a stylesheet framework and converting designs to code through **SASS and HTML**.|

## 2. The Problem

> Updating the user interface design to have a more **modern look and feel** while **identifying painpoints in user experience**.

When I first started on the Victorian Reports redesign, my main goal was to identify **issues in accessibility and user flow** that can be improved upon for a better experience. At the same time, I also wanted to revitalise the interface to be more modern and consistent with the other redesigns I've been working on for the Open Law suite.

In order to achieve this, I **worked closely with the software development team and legal professionals within our organisation** to understand the technical and user needs of this product.

Currently, the redesigns for the Victorian Reports have been fully completed, and a majority of the frontend development have also been done. We are hoping to launch the redesign soon.


## Solving the problem

This project was completed using a **lean-agile approach**, focusing on **how we can bring value to our customers** through iterative cycles and continuous feedback loops.

        </figure>
    </a>
</div>

Since the Victorian Reports website has been a long-standing platform available to users online, I **started the design process from reflecting on what we have so far**.

## Special thanks
Thank you to the director of Open Law – [Michael Green SC](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-green-sc-42118b1/) for the opportunity to work on this project. I would also like to thank [Nick&nbsp;Clark](https://clarx.dev/) who showed me the ropes to Tailwind, SASS and taught me so much about frontend development with immense patience.

## 1. The Team

| Human | Role |
|:-- |:--|
| [The&nbsp;Open&nbsp;Law&nbsp;Team](https://openlaw.com.au/) | The software development team are the ones who bring my designs to life. Can't do it without the team!|
| Me! | Lead Designer – completely overhauled the user interface from scratch using reusable components from my [UI Design System](/projects/openlaw/) to **enhance the end-to-end user experience**. <br/> </br> Assisted the frontend development team by developing a stylesheet framework and converting designs to code through **SASS and HTML**.|

## 2. The Problem

Updating the user interface design to have a more **modern look and feel** while **identifying painpoints in user experience**.

## 1. The team
| Human | Role |
|:-- |:--|
| [Nicole&nbsp;Cama](https://nicolecama.com.au) | Project Lead – professional historian specialising in public history who led this project, provided archival images and conducted the all the historical research for this project |
| [Nick&nbsp;Clark](https://clarx.dev/) | Software Engineer – created the site from the ground-up and provided the base for SASS styling |
| Me! | Lead Designer – digitising archival maps, graphic and web design, and SASS styling site-wide |

## 2. The brief
From the first briefing email, Nicole provided me with a clear outline and attached a detailed brief along with some images for the vibe of the site:
> ...a data visualisation project mapping the people and structures of Liverpool Street, Darlinghurst based on a particular historical source dating from 1845 to 1948. [...] a website which will creatively illustrate the data from this source using graphics, media and other interactive strategies.

## 3. The problem
> “How can we visualise a whole century of historical data for a modern, general audience?”
1. How can we avoid information fatigue?
2. How do we tie together information from separate time periods?
3. Can we incorporate archival images?

## 4. Solving the problem
We started off the design process with some mood-boards and brainstorming. Below is a mood-board that Nicole had included in the project brief, which had some archival images that set the tone of how the project might look and feel. These images are in the public domain and some were used as visual assets in the final project.

I became involved in the Darlinghurst Liverpool Street Project on **May 25, 2023**.
I remember that, at this point, it had already been several months since **Nick Clark** had spoken about **Nicole Cama**'s brilliant research and ideas for a web project. Nick was an old coworker of mine, and it was very exciting for me to work on a project with him outside of the work context.

I was hooked from the get-go when I heard that the project would be about showing the history of a place where most Sydney-siders would have walked past without thinking twice. In fact, I'm pretty sure that I've walked through that street many times myself! 

I think that Nicole's passionate deep dive into the stories and histories of Liverpool Street might also encourage viewers of this project to consider the hidden stories behind streets or locations of their own neighbourhoods. How many of us walk by a historically significant site without knowing at all? I hope that this project will spark curiosity not only towards Liverpool Street, but also beyond.

The Liverpool Street Project was delivered in November 2023. This made it a process of iteration for almost 6 months! Needless to say, as our ideas evolved, the designs also changed to reflect them. Nicole gave me a couple of questions to answer relating to the design process and I'm more than happy to answer!

## Can you describe your design process once you understood the scope, purpose and vision for this website?

The design process for this project included a lot of **brainstorming**, **sketching** and iterating **throughout** the project. To show how this process evolved, I'll include some snippets from the initial emails exchanged between Nicole and I!

### **Brainstorming**

From the first briefing email, Nicole provided me with a clear outline and attached a detailed brief along with some images for the vibe of the site:
> *...a **data visualisation project** mapping the people and structures of Liverpool Street, Darlinghurst based on a particular historical source dating **from 1845 to 1948**. I need to produce a website which will creatively illustrate the data from this source **using graphics, media and other interactive strategies**.*

 The images and brief given gave me a roadmap for the look and feel of the site, as well as a source for images in the public domain that can be used as assets in the project.
 
Some initial ideas in the reply:
> - Vectorising/tracing and splitting the historical survey plan/map into different sections
> - One of the sections will feature the following:
> 	- Illustrations of different types of building on Liverpool St from a front-on perspective with colour coding + key for the various materials used in the original construction plans  
> - Thinking that in order to show the datasets in an interactive way, information can be overlapped on the aerial map of Liverpool St.
> - Similar to aerial view Google Maps, but information that’s overlapped changes depending on the “filter” the user selects
> 	- Filters might be the building fabric + gender proportions
> 		- Building fabric might be a toggle-able overlay on the map that colours the buildings depending on what it’s made of + a key that explains what each colour represents. I'll need a bit more clarification of what the dataset exactly includes, I think.  
> 		- Maybe gender proportion can be represented through pedestrian icons on the map, with a pie chart in the corner of the map for clarity
> 			- It would be interesting to have some of these icons be clickable to view stories of people with their portraits  
> - To show how the street transforms over time, maybe there could be a scrollable timeline where the user can see how the map changes depending on what year they’re on
> 	- A bit like this: [https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/](https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/) but at a smaller scale and with illustrations instead of satellite images  
> - The overall style of the project will use an ink-like illustration style with a sepia tone similar to the documents shown.

Some of these ideas were changed in later iterations of the project for technical or usability reasons, but after a few more calls, we were ready to get the ball rolling visually!
### Sketching
The initial sketches for the project looked very different to how the site looks now.
These sketches had more reliance on overlays and popups, which ended up not being a good idea for the amount of information we ended up having. However, some aspects like the timeline and graphical style carried through.

### Iterations
The first iterations of the site was a single page site with only the map as focus. 
However, as the project's scope expanded, the design process became a lot more agile.

Nicole and Nick implemented the Stories, Street Data and About pages, I helped with styling the Stories Pages using CSS in the front-end. Nick and Nicole designed the About and Street Data pages entirely! I designed a header to bring the site pages together.

As the site evolved away from using overlays, new panels were designed using archival images to show statistics of building owners and types. Originally, the architectural drawings of the first two buildings didn't have colour, which required me to shade it manually to match the other diagrams. The question mark for Unknown was also illustrated to fit in with the rest of the site:

An alternative layout for the stories of Liverpool Street was also designed for the home page but wasn't implemented in the end. The icons of the stories were derived from archival images provided by Nicole. 
Some of the icons were hand-illustrated for consistency since there weren't any inked archival drawings available.

## What was your biggest design challenge with this website?

I think the hardest design challenge with this website was digitising the many map pieces from 1865–1930s so that they would overlap and show changes throughout time. Very grateful to Nicole for getting the map files together and finding missing parts of maps. It was so satisfying putting the map pieces in place like a jigsaw puzzle. 

I found it incredible how maps created almost 200 years ago were so accurate without having satellite technology or even helicopters -- especially how they're all drawn with ink and watercolour! Tracing the maps in Illustrator was already a super time-consuming process (even with the focus only on Liverpool Street). I wonder how they used to be done.

## What part are you most proud of?

I'm most proud of the digitised maps of Liverpool Street!
I'm also quite happy about the way the stories pages turned out.
The layout and design of the stories pages were done by Nick Clark and I helped to refine the CSS for stylistic consistency with the rest of the site. Nicole provided the writing and archival images for each story.
I feel like as a whole, the stories pages feel very comfortable and engaging to read.

## What did you learn from doing this project?

In terms of what I've learned from a design perspective, this project taught me the importance of flexibility and improvisation. As the project evolved and expanded in scope, it was important for me to work with the team in an agile way.

I also learnt a lot about Liverpool Street from reading the stories and looking at the visual material provided to me by Nicole! The stories, in particular, were intriguing windows into how people used to live in the past.

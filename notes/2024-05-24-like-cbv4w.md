        		<!-- My site has a cute mascot! Learn more about him at https://jamesg.blog/mascot/.
        		A friend suggested I come up with a name other than James, which I gave to the mascot in the aforelinked post. I thought about MJ, short for Mascot James.
        		Herein, my mascot will be MJ and James. Or perhaps any of the myriad other nicknames I am likely to come up with over the years.

        		I hired someone to design this mascot. The aforelinked post provides more information and a recommendation for the designer!
